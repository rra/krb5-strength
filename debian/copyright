Copyright-Grant:
 The author disclaims all responsibility or liability with respect to it's
 usage or its effect upon hardware or computer systems, and maintains
 copyright as set out in the "LICENCE" document which accompanies
 distributions of Crack v4.0 and upwards.
License: Artistic-CrackLib
 This documents purpose is to state the conditions under which these
 Packages (See definition below) viz: "Crack", the Unix Password Cracker,
 and "CrackLib", the Unix Password Checking library, which are held in
 copyright by Alec David Edward Muffett, may be copied, such that the
 copyright holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the
 development of the packages, while giving the users of the package the
 right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
 fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.
 .
 So there.
 .
 ***************************************************************************
 .
 Definitions:
 .
 A "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
 Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created
 through textual modification, or segments thereof.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
 or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright
 Holder.
 .
 "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights
 for the package.
 .
 "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
 Package.
 .
 "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of
 media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.
 (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but
 only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the
 fee.)
 .
 "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
 though there may be fees involved in handling the item.  It also means
 that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
 conditions they received it.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
 duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
 disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
 modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
 provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating
 how and when AND WHY you changed that file, and provided that you do at
 least ONE of the following:
 .
 a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
 Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
 equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
 such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
 your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 .
 b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 .
 c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
 standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide separate
 documentation for each non-standard executable that clearly documents
 how it differs from the Standard Version.
 .
 d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
 a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
 together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
 to get the Standard Version.
 .
 b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
 Package with your modifications.
 .
 c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
 Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
 non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual
 pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the
 Standard Version.
 .
 d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
 Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.
 YOU MAY NOT CHARGE A FEE FOR THIS PACKAGE ITSELF.  However, you may
 distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
 programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
 provided that YOU DO NOT ADVERTISE this package as a product of your
 own.
 .
 6. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
 promote products derived from this software without specific prior
 written permission.
 .
 7. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
