heimdal\-history \- Password history via Heimdal external strength checking
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBheimdal-history\fR [\fB\-chmq\fR] [\fB\-b\fR \fItarget-time\fR] [\fB\-d\fR \fIdatabase\fR]
    [\fB\-S\fR \fIlength-stats-db\fR] [\fB\-s\fR \fIstrength-program\fR] [\fBprincipal\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBheimdal-history\fR is an implementation of password history via the Heimdal
external password strength checking interface.  It stores separate history for
each principal, hashed using Crypt::PBKDF2 with randomly-generated salt.  (The
randomness is from a weak pseudorandom number generator, not strongly random.)
Password history is stored indefinitely (implementing infinite history); older
password hashes are never removed by this program.
.PP
Password history is stored in a BerkeleyDB \s-1DB_HASH\s0 file.  The key is the
principal.  The value is a \s-1JSON\s0 array of objects, each of which has two keys.
\&\f(CW\*(C`timestamp\*(C'\fR contains the time when the history entry was added (in \s-1POSIX\s0
seconds since \s-1UNIX\s0 epoch), and \f(CW\*(C`hash\*(C'\fR contains the hash of a previously-used
password in the Crypt::PBKDF2 LDAP-compatible format.  Passwords are hashed
using \s-1PBKDF2\s0 (from PKCS#5) with \s-1SHA\-256\s0 as the underlying hash function using
a number of rounds configured in this script.  See Crypt::PBKDF2 for more
information.
.PP
\&\fBheimdal-history\fR also checks password strength before checking history.  It
does so by invoking another program that also uses the Heimdal external
password strength checking interface.  By default, it runs
\&\fB/usr/bin/heimdal\-strength\fR.  Only if that program approves the password does
it hash it and check history.
.PP
For more information on how to set up password history, see \*(L"\s-1CONFIGURATION\*(R"\s0
below.
.PP
As with any implementation of the Heimdal external password strength checking
protocol, \fBheimdal-history\fR expects, on standard input:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    principal: <principal>
\&    new\-password: <password>
\&    end
.Ve
.PP
(with no leading whitespace).  <principal> is the principal changing its
password (passed to the other password strength checking program but otherwise
unused here), and <password> is the new password.  There must be exactly one
space after the colon.  Any subsequent spaces are taken to be part of the
principal or password.
.PP
If the password is accepted, \fBheimdal-history\fR will assume that it will be
used and will update the history database to record the new password.  It will
also update the password length statistics database to account for the new
password.
.PP
If invoked as root, \fBheimdal-history\fR will run the external strength checking
program as user \f(CW\*(C`nobody\*(C'\fR and group \f(CW\*(C`nogroup\*(C'\fR, and will check and write to
the history database as user \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR and group \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR.  These users
must exist on the system if it is run as root.
.PP
The result of each password check will be logged to syslog (priority \s-1LOG_INFO,\s0
facility \s-1LOG_AUTH\s0).  Each log line will be a set of key/value pairs in the
format \f(CW\*(C`\f(CIkey\f(CW=\f(CIvalue\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  The keys are:
.IP "action" 4
.IX Item "action"
The action performed (currently always \f(CW\*(C`check\*(C'\fR).
.IP "principal" 4
.IX Item "principal"
The principal for which a password was checked.
.IP "error" 4
.IX Item "error"
An internal error message that did not stop the history check, but which may
indicate that something is wrong with the history database (such as corrupted
entries or invalid hashes).  If this key is present, neither \f(CW\*(C`result\*(C'\fR nor
\&\f(CW\*(C`reason\*(C'\fR will be present.  There will be a subsequent log message from the
same invocation giving the final result of the history check (assuming
\&\fBheimdal-history\fR doesn't exit with a fatal error).
.IP "result" 4
.IX Item "result"
Either \f(CW\*(C`accepted\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`rejected\*(C'\fR.
.IP "reason" 4
.IX Item "reason"
If the password was rejected, the reason for the rejection.
.PP
The value will be surrounded with double quotes if it contains a double quote
or space.  Any double quotes in the value will be doubled, so \f(CW\*(C`"\*(C'\fR becomes
\&\f(CW""\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fItarget-time\fR, \fB\-\-benchmark\fR=\fItarget-time\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b target-time, --benchmark=target-time"
Do not do a password history check.  Instead, benchmark the hash algorithm
with various possible iteration counts and find an iteration count that
results in \fItarget-time\fR seconds of computation time required to hash a
password (which should be a real number).  A result will be considered
acceptable if it is within 0.005 seconds of the target time.  The results will
be printed to standard output and then \fBheimdal-history\fR will exit
successfully.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --check-only"
Check password history and password strength and print the results as normal,
but do not update the history or length statistics databases.  This is a
read-only mode of operation that will not make any changes to the underlying
database, only report if a password would currently be accepted.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fIdatabase\fR, \fB\-\-database\fR=\fIdatabase\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d database, --database=database"
Use \fIdatabase\fR as the history database file instead of the default
(\fI/var/lib/heimdal\-history/history.db\fR).  Primarily used for testing, since
Heimdal won't pass this argument.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print a short usage message and exit.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-manual\fR, \fB\-\-man\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --manual, --man"
Display this manual and exit.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q, --quiet"
Suppress logging to syslog and only return the results on standard output and
standard error.  Primarily used for testing, since Heimdal won't pass this
argument.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR \fIlength-stats-db\fR, \fB\-\-stats\fR=\fIlength-stats-db\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S length-stats-db, --stats=length-stats-db"
Use \fIlength-stats-db\fR as the database file for password length statistics
instead of the default (\fI/var/lib/heimdal\-history/lengths.db\fR).  Primarily
used for testing, since Heimdal won't pass this argument.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR \fIstrength-program\fR, \fB\-\-strength\fR=\fIstrength-program\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s strength-program, --strength=strength-program"
Run \fIstrength-program\fR as the external strength-checking program instead of
the default (\fI/usr/bin/heimdal\-strength\fR).  Primarily used for testing, since
Heimdal won't pass this argument.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
Additional setup is required to use this history implementation with your
Heimdal \s-1KDC.\s0
.PP
First, ensure that its dependencies are installed, and then examine the local
configuration settings at the top of the \fBheimdal-history\fR program.  By
default, it requires a \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR user and \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR group be present on
the system, and all history information will be read and written as that user
and group.  It also requires a \f(CW\*(C`nobody\*(C'\fR user and \f(CW\*(C`nogroup\*(C'\fR group to be
present (this should be the default with most variants of \s-1UNIX\s0), and all
strength checking will be done as that user and group.  It uses various files
in \fI/var/lib/heimdal\-history\fR to store history and statistical information by
default, so if using the defaults, create that directory and ensure it is
writable by the \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR user.
.PP
Once that setup is done, change your \f(CW\*(C`[password_quality]\*(C'\fR configuration in
\&\fIkrb5.conf\fR or \fIkdc.conf\fR to:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    [password_quality]
\&        policies         = external\-check
\&        external_program = /usr/local/bin/heimdal\-history
.Ve
.PP
The \fBheimdal-history\fR program will automatically also run \fBheimdal-strength\fR
as well, looking for it in \fI/usr/bin\fR.  Change the \f(CW$STRENGTH_PROGRAM\fR
setting at the top of the script if you have that program in a different
location.  You should continue to configure \fBheimdal-strength\fR as if you were
running it directly.
.SH "RETURN STATUS"
.IX Header "RETURN STATUS"
On approval of the password, \fBheimdal-history\fR will print \f(CW\*(C`APPROVED\*(C'\fR and a
newline to standard output and exit with status 0.
.PP
If the password is rejected by the strength checking program or if it (or a
version with a single character removed) matches one of the hashes stored in
the password history, \fBheimdal-history\fR will print the reason for rejection
to standard error and exit with status 0.
.PP
On any internal error, \fBheimdal-history\fR will print the error to standard
error and exit with a non-zero status.
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
.IP "\fI/usr/bin/heimdal\-strength\fR" 4
.IX Item "/usr/bin/heimdal-strength"
The default password strength checking program.  This program must follow the
Heimdal external password strength checking \s-1API.\s0
.IP "\fI/var/lib/heimdal\-history/history.db\fR" 4
.IX Item "/var/lib/heimdal-history/history.db"
The default database path.  If \fBheimdal-strength\fR is run as root, this file
needs to be readable and writable by user \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR and group \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR.
If it doesn't exist, it will be created with mode 0600.
.IP "\fI/var/lib/heimdal\-history/history.db.lock\fR" 4
.IX Item "/var/lib/heimdal-history/history.db.lock"
The lock file used to synchronize access to the history database.  As with the
history database, if \fBheimdal-strength\fR is run as root, this file needs to be
readable and writable by user \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR and group \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fI/var/lib/heimdal\-history/lengths.db\fR" 4
.IX Item "/var/lib/heimdal-history/lengths.db"
The default length statistics path, which will be a BerkeleyDB \s-1DB_HASH\s0 file of
password lengths to counts of passwords with that length.  If
\&\fBheimdal-strength\fR is run as root, this file needs to be readable and
writable by user \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR and group \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR.  If it doesn't exist, it
will be created with mode 0600.
.IP "\fI/var/lib/heimdal\-history/lengths.db.lock\fR" 4
.IX Item "/var/lib/heimdal-history/lengths.db.lock"
The lock file used to synchronize access to the length statistics database.
As with the length statistics database, if \fBheimdal-strength\fR is run as root,
this file needs to be readable and writable by user \f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR and group
\&\f(CW\*(C`_history\*(C'\fR.
