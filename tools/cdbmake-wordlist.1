cdbmake\-wordlist \- Create a cdb database from a wordlist
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBcdbmake-wordlist\fR [\fB\-am\fR] [\fB\-l\fR \fImin-length\fR] [\fB\-L\fR \fImax-length\fR]
    [\fB\-o\fR \fIoutput-wordlist\fR] [\fB\-x\fR \fIexclude\fR ...] \fIwordlist\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
cdb is a format invented by Dan Bernstein for fast, constant databases.
The database is fixed during creation and cannot be changed without
rebuilding it, and is optimized for very fast access.  This program takes
as input a wordlist file (a set of words, possibly including whitespace,
separated by newlines) and turns it into a cdb file with the words as keys
and the constant \f(CW1\fR as a value.  The resulting database is suitable for
fast existence lookups in the wordlist, such as for password dictionary
checks.
.PP
\&\fBcdbmake-wordlist\fR takes one argument, the input wordlist file.  The
output cdb database will have the same name as \fIwordlist\fR but with
\&\f(CW\*(C`.cdb\*(C'\fR appended.  The input wordlist file does not have to be sorted.
.PP
\&\fBcdbmake-wordlist\fR can, instead of building a \s-1CDB\s0 file, filter a wordlist
against the criteria given on the command line and generate a new
wordlist.  See the \fB\-o\fR option for more details.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-ascii\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a, --ascii"
Filter all words that contain non-ASCII characters or control characters
from the resulting cdb file, leaving only words that consist solely of
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 non-control characters.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR \fImaximum\fR, \fB\-\-max\-length\fR=\fImaximum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L maximum, --max-length=maximum"
Filter all words of length greater than \fImaximum\fR from the resulting cdb
database.  The length of each line (minus the separating newline) in the
input wordlist will be checked against \fIminimum\fR and will be filtered out
of the resulting database if it is shorter.  Useful for generating
password dictionaries from word lists that contain random noise that's
highly unlikely to be used as a password.
.Sp
The default is to not filter out any words for maximum length.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fIminimum\fR, \fB\-\-min\-length\fR=\fIminimum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l minimum, --min-length=minimum"
Filter all words of length less than \fIminimum\fR from the resulting cdb
database.  The length of each line (minus the separating newline) in the
input wordlist will be checked against \fIminimum\fR and will be filtered out
of the resulting database if it is shorter.  Useful for generating password
dictionaries where shorter passwords will be rejected by a generic length
check and no dictionary lookup will be done for a transform of the password
shorter than the specified minimum.
.Sp
The default is not to filter out any words for minimum length.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-man\fR, \fB\-\-manual\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --man, --manual"
Print out this documentation (which is done simply by feeding the script to
\&\f(CW\*(C`perldoc \-t\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIwordlist\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIwordlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o wordlist, --output=wordlist"
Rather than creating a \s-1CDB\s0 database, apply the filter rules given by the
other command-line arguments and generate a new wordlist in the file name
given by the \fIwordlist\fR option.  This can be used to reduce the size of
a raw wordlist file (such as one taken from Internet sources) by removing
the words that will be filtered out of the \s-1CDB\s0 file anyway, thus reducing
the size of the source required to regenerate the \s-1CDB\s0 database.
.Sp
If this option is given, no \s-1CDB\s0 database will be created.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR \fIexclude\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fIexclude\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x exclude, --exclude=exclude"
Filter all words matching the regular expression \fIexclude\fR from the
resulting cdb database.  This regular expression will be matched against
each line of the source wordlist after the trailing newline is removed.
This option may be given repeatedly to add multiple exclusion regexes.
