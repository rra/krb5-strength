    You will also need Perl 5.010 or later and the Const::Fast, DBI,
    DBD::SQLite, JSON::MaybeXS, and Perl6::Slurp modules (from CPAN) to
    bootstrap the test suite data from a Git checkout.

    By default, the Heimdal external password check function is installed as
    `/usr/local/bin/heimdal-strength`, and the plugin is installed as
    `/usr/local/lib/krb5/plugins/pwqual/strength.so`.  You can change these
    paths with the `--prefix`, `--libdir`, and `--bindir` options to
    `configure`.

    By default, the embedded version of CrackLib will be used.  To build with
    the system version of CrackLib, pass `--with-cracklib` to `configure`.
    You can optionally add a directory, giving the root directory where
    CrackLib was installed, or separately set the include and library path
    with `--with-cracklib-include` and `--with-cracklib-lib`.  You can also
    build without any CrackLib support by passing `--without-cracklib` to
    `configure`.

    krb5-strength will automatically build with TinyCDB if it is found.  To
    specify the installation path of TinyCDB, use `--with-tinycdb`.  You can
    also separately set the include and library path with
    `--with-tinycdb-include` and `--with-tinycdb-lib`.

    Similarly, krb5-strength will automatically build with SQLite if it is
    found.  To specify the installation path of SQLite, use `--with-sqlite`.
    You can also separately set the include and library path with
    `--with-sqlite-include` and `--with-sqlite-lib`.

blurb: |
  krb5-strength provides a password quality plugin for the MIT Kerberos KDC
  (specifically the kadmind server) and Heimdal KDC, an external password
  quality program for use with Heimdal, and a per-principal password history
  implementation for Heimdal.  Passwords can be tested with CrackLib,
  checked against a CDB or SQLite database of known weak passwords with some
  transformations, checked for length, checked for non-printable or
  non-ASCII characters that may be difficult to enter reproducibly, required
  to contain particular character classes, or any combination of these
  tests.

description: |
  Heimdal includes a capability to plug in external password quality checks
  and comes with an example that checks passwords against CrackLib.
  However, in testing at Stanford, we found that CrackLib with its default
  transform rules does not catch passwords that can be guessed using the
  same dictionary with other tools, such as Jack the Ripper.  We then
  discovered other issues with CrackLib with longer passwords, such as some
  bad assumptions about how certain measures of complexity will scale, and
  wanted to impose other limitations that it didn't support.

  This plugin provides the ability to check password quality against the
  standard version of CrackLib, or against a modified version of CrackLib
  that only passes passwords that resist attacks from both Crack and Jack
  the Ripper using the same rule sets.  It also supports doing simpler
  dictionary checks against a CDB database, which is fast with very large
  dictionaries, or a SQLite database, which can reject all passwords within
  edit distance one of a dictionary word.  It can also impose other
  programmatic checks on passwords such as character class requirements.

  If you're just now starting with password checking, I recommend using the
  SQLite database with a large wordlist and minimum password lengths.  We
  found this produced the best results with the least user frustration.

  For Heimdal, krb5-strength includes both a program usable as an external
  password quality check and a plugin that implements the dynamic module
  API.  For MIT Kerberos (1.9 or later), it includes a plugin for the
  password quality (pwqual) plugin API.

  krb5-strength can be built with either the system CrackLib or with the
  modified version of CrackLib included in this package.  Note, however,
  that if you're building against the system CrackLib, Heimdal includes in
  the distribution a strength-checking plugin and an external password check
  program that use the system CrackLib.  With Heimdal, it would probably be
  easier to use that plugin or program than build this package unless you
  want the modified CrackLib, one of the other dictionary types, or the
  additional character class and length checks.

  For information about the changes to the CrackLib included in this
  toolkit, see `cracklib/HISTORY`.  The primary changes are tighter rules,
  which are more aggressive at finding dictionary words with characters
  appended and prepended, which tighten the requirements for password
  entropy, and which add stricter rules for longer passwords.  They are also
  minor changes to fix portability issues, remove some code that doesn't
  make sense in the kadmind context, and close a few security issues.  The
  standard CrackLib distribution on at least some Linux distributions now
  supports an additional interface to configure its behavior, and
  krb5-strength should change in the future to use that interface and drop
  the embedded copy.

  krb5-strength also includes a password history implementation for Heimdal.
  This is separate from the password strength implementation but can be
  stacked with it so that both strength and history checks are performed.
  This history implementation is available only via the Heimdal external
  password quality interface.  MIT Kerberos includes its own password
  history implementation.

requirements: |
  For Heimdal, you may use either the external password quality check tool,
  installed as heimdal-strength, or the plugin as you choose.  It has been
  tested with Heimdal 1.2.1 and later, but has not recently been tested with
  versions prior to 7.0.

  For MIT Kerberos, version 1.9 or higher is required for the password
  quality plugin interface.  MIT Kerberos does not support an external
  password quality check tool directly, so you will need to install the
  plugin.

  You can optionally build against the system CrackLib library.  Any version
  should be supported, but note that some versions, particularly older
  versions close to the original code, do things like printing diagnostics
  to stderr, calling exit, and otherwise not being well-behaved for use
  inside plugins or libraries.  They also have known security
  vulnerabilities.  If using a system CrackLib library, use version 2.8.22
  or later to avoid these problems.

  You can also optionally build against the TinyCDB library, which provides
  support for simpler and faster password checking against a CDB dictionary
  file, and the SQLite library (a version new enough to support the
  `sqlite3_open_v2` API; 3.7 should be more than sufficient), which provides
  support for checking whether passwords are within edit distance one of a
  dictionary word.

  For this module to be effective for either Heimdal or MIT Kerberos, you
  will also need to construct a dictionary.  The `mkdict` and `packer`
  utilities to build a CrackLib dictionary from a word list are included in
  this toolkit but not installed by default.  You can run them out of the
  `cracklib` directory after building.  You can also use the utilities that
  come with the stock CrackLib package (often already packaged in a Linux
  distribution); the database format is compatible.

  For building a CDB or SQLite dictionary, use the provided
  `krb5-strength-wordlist` program.  For CDB dictionries, the `cdb` utility
  must be on your `PATH`.  For SQLite, the DBI and DBD::SQLite Perl modules
  are required.  `krb5-strength-wordlist` requires Perl 5.010 or later.

  For a word list to use as source for the dictionary, you can use
  `/usr/share/dict/words` if it's available on your system, but it would be
  better to find a more comprehensive word list.  Since word lists are
  bulky, often covered by murky copyrights, and easily locatable on the
  Internet with a modicum of searching, none are included in this toolkit.

  The password history program, heimdal-history, requires Perl 5.010 or
  later plus the following CPAN modules:

  * Const::Fast
  * Crypt::PBKDF2
  * DB_File::Lock
  * Getopt::Long::Descriptive
  * IPC::Run
  * JSON::MaybeXS

  and their dependencies.

test:
  lancaster: true
  suffix: |
    To run the test suite, you will need Perl 5.010 or later and the
    dependencies of the `heimdal-history` program.  The following additional
    Perl modules will also be used by the test suite if present:

    * Perl6::Slurp
    * Test::MinimumVersion
    * Test::Perl::Critic
    * Test::Pod
    * Test::Spelling
    * Test::Strict

    All are available on CPAN.  Some tests will be skipped if the modules
    are not available.
